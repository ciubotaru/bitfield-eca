INSTALLATION
------------

To compile bitfield-eca from source code:

$ autoconf
$ ./configure --prefix=DIRECTORY
$ make

The only compile-time and run-time dependency is Vitalie Ciubotaru's 'bitfield'
library (at least version 0.6.*). If bitfield is not installed, or if the
sources were configured with the '--with-local-bitfield' flag, make will assume
that the source code of bitfield is available in the source tree (in 'bitfield'
directory) and will attempt to build it first.

`make` builds a shared and a static library. For a shared or a static library
only, do `make shared` or `make static`.

`make check` or `make test` runs some tests agains the newly-built library.

`make examples` runs some examples with graphical output.

The generic way to install the compiled files is:

$ make install
$ ldconfig

However, one might prefer to use distro-specific installation mechanism (like 
"checkinstall") instead.
